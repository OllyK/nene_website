* Currently working as a Senior Research Software Engineer at the University of Oxford.
* Formerly a chemical biologist developing early-stage drugs for histone lysine [demethylase][demeth] enzymes - important epigenetic regulators of gene expression.
* Contributor to the open-source [SuRVoS][surv1] and [SuRVoS2][surv2] applications that allow faster annotation and segmentation of 3D image data with the help of supervoxels, scribbles and machine learning.
* Creator of [volume-segmantics][vol-seg] - a software package that allows fast training of a variety of 2D pre-trained segmentation networks on 3D image data. 
* Trainer of the [CHiMP (Crystal Hits in My Plate)][chimp] deep learning tools. These help scientist to classify images of protein crystallisation experiments and to detect crystals in images for data collection.
