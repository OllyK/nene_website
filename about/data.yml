      <p>
      After several years working in the laboratory on insecure, fixed-term, academic contracts 
      I decided to take the plunge and change career. Having taught myself how to program in Python 
      I left my job and enrolled in a Computer Science course in order to learn the fundamentals 
      and gain more relevant experience.
      </p>
      <p>
      Courses taken included: Programming in C and Java, Computer Architecture, Web Technologies and Databases.
      For my research project I set up a collaboration with a lab that I'd worked in previously. 
      The project used texture analysis in combination with machine learning (clustering, random forests) to 
      detect crystals in microscope images. Work was done in collaboration with the Structural Genomics Consortium, 
      University of Oxford and iXpressGenes Ltd., Huntsville, Alabama.

      Growing a protein crystal is the first step in determining the 3D atomic structure of that protein using
      X-ray crystallography. Knowing the structure, in turn, gives insight into how these molecules function,
      how changes (mutations) such as those associated with cancers, affect their function and how drugs can
      be made to target specific proteins in order to treat disease. Growing a crystal is difficult and unlikely.
      To improve their chances, a crystallographer may set up hundreds of microscopic experiments. In each
      experiment, the protein of interest is mixed with a different ‘cocktail’ of chemical components that has
      been selected from a library of these cocktails. The experiments are then imaged using a robotic system
      and the micrographs either inspected manually or analysed computationally.
      TeXRank is software, developed by, and currently in use at, the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC)
      at the University of Oxford. It uses texture analysis to score images for the likely presence of crystals and
      then displays these images to the experimenter in rank order. This reduces the number of images that
      have to be viewed before finding a crystal. This project builds upon this work with the aim of providing
      new tools to the experimenter that have the potential to improve their chances of successfully growing or
      identifying a crystal of a given protein.
      In particular, the project includes:
      <ul>
        <li>
        methodology to find a set of chemical cocktail conditions that can be used as a tool to improve the
        solubility of sparingly soluble proteins (a limiting factor in obtaining crystals)
        </li>
        <li>
        a ‘virtual’ experiment to evaluate the potential usefulness of the solubility tool
        </li>
        <li>
        adaptation of image processing and machine learning methods to allow TeXRank to use microscope
        images, captured under green light, of experiments containing protein labelled with a fluorescent
        dye
        </li>
        <li>
        an evaluation of the usefulness of the novel combination of texture analysis with fluorescence
        labelling, both in comparison to standard imaging and to studies in the literature.
        </li>
      </ul>
      The main outcomes of this project were:
      <ul>
        <li>
        a set of 48 chemical cocktail conditions, selected through mining the results of image analysis on
        real experimental data and found to be significantly better as solubility tool than a random set of
        conditions (p < 0.05)
        </li>
        <li>
        adaptations to the TeXRank processing pipeline and the training of a new classifier that allows the
        ranking of images from experiments containing fluorescent labelled protein
        </li>
        <li>
        a comparison of ranking performance between pairs of images taken of the same experiments,
        proving that the use of fluorescence in combination with texture analysis is better than texture
        analysis alone
        </li>
        <li>
        the fluorescence classifier created in this project also has superior ranking characteristics (area
        under receiver operating characteristic curve) to the current classifier used by TeXRank
        </li>
        <li>
        comparison to the research literature determined that texton analysis was more accurate at detecting
        fluorescent protein crystals than a recent study that utilised image thresholding followed by edge
        detection
        </li>
      </ul>

      Studies on the Electrodeposition of Calcium Phosphate Coatings for Orthopaedic 
      Applications and the Potential Incorporation of Apatite-Coated Liposomes
    advisor: Jan T. Czernuszka
    year: 2006
    notes: |
      <p>
      I was awarded funding by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council for this independent 
      research project to develop novel, improved coatings for orthopaedic implants with drug-delivery capability. 
      Analysis techniques that I used included scanning and transmission electron microscopy, electron diffraction 
      and X-ray powder diffraction crystallography.
      </p>
      <p>
      When not in the lab, I spent time as the Chair of the departmental Joint Consultative Committee for Graduates 
      and was the Social Secretary of St. Catherine's College Middle Common where I helped to organise parties and 
      events for hundreds of graduate students. In addition I sat on the college IT committee and worked as a college 
      porter and in a student IT support role.

      <p>
      A low temperature electrodeposition technique has been used to
      coat metal substrates with calcium phosphate (CaP) phases at
      37&#8451; in aqueous solution buffered at <em>p</em>H 7.4.
      Experiments have also been carried out on liposome vesicles, some
      populations of which were coated in CaP, the final aim being to
      combine the liposome vesicles with the coating methodology in
      order to produce composite coatings with a drug delivery
      capability.
      </p>
      <p>
      Factors relating to the coating procedure that were altered
      included: the initial coating solution concentration, the drying
      method and the time for which the samples were allowed to remain
      in solution (maturation). The effects upon the coatings were
      studied using X-ray diffraction (XRD), low voltage-scanning
      electron microscopy (LV-SEM), transmission electron microscopy
      (TEM), electron diffraction and measurement of coating shear
      strengths.
      </p>
      <p>
      LV-SEM revealed that one hour or more of maturation time in
      solution, after one electrodeposition coating cycle, led to a
      dramatic change in coating morphology from a thin particulate
      coating, to one with a coherent structure of interconnected
      crystallites. The initial coating cycle allowed the formation of a
      thin amorphous layer of CaP, which then acts as a seeding site for
      subsequent coating growth. TEM and electron diffraction of
      coatings revealed that the coating crystallinity increased with
      maturation time. The coating was determined to be hydroxyapatite
      (HAp) with a preferred orientation of crystallites with their
      <em>c</em>-axis perpendicular to the substrate that became more
      pronounced with increased maturation time.
      </p>
      <p>
      Critical point drying (CPD) appeared to protect the structure of
      the coatings when compared to air drying. Shear strengths were
      modulated by alterations in maturation time. Penetration of the
      coating structure by epoxy resin during the testing procedure may
      have been a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
      The results of these studies show that the treatment of the
      initial calcium phosphate layer deposited onto a metal substrate
      during coating has profound implications for coating structure and
      strength.
      </p>
      <p>
      Lipid vesicles, manufactured from egg phosphatidylcholine (EPC)
      containing 30 mol &percnt; cholesterol and 4 mol &percnt; &alpha;-tocopherol,
      were characterised in terms of entrapment efficiency and release
      of both the marker molecule calcein and the antibiotic gentamicin.
      A higher percentage release of calcein was measured from
      CaP-coated liposomes when compared to uncoated vesicles when
      incubated for periods in excess of 70 h at 37&#8451;,
      indicating that CaP ultimately increased the permeability of the
      liposomal membranes.
      </p>
      <p>
      Addition of CaP-coated liposomes to coating solutions, during the
      electrodeposition of calcium phosphate, was found to moderate the
      decrease in HAp and octacalcium phosphate supersaturation that was
      normally seen in their absence. Composite coatings, incorporating
      liposomes that contained calcein were also manufactured.
