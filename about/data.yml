      <p>
      After several years working in the lab on insecure, fixed-term, academic contracts 
      I decided to take the plunge and change career. Having taught myself how to program in Python 
      I left my job and enrolled in a Computer Science course in order to learn the fundamentals 
      and gain more relevant experience.  
      Courses taken included: Programming in C and Java, Computer Architecture, Web Technologies and Databases.
      My research project used texture analysis in combination with machine learning (clustering, random forests) to 
      detect crystals in microscope images. Work was done in collaboration with the Structural Genomics Consortium, 
      University of Oxford and iXpressGenes Ltd., Huntsville, Alabama.

      Growing a protein crystal is the first step in determining the 3D atomic structure of that protein using
      X-ray crystallography. Knowing the structure, in turn, gives insight into how these molecules function,
      how changes (mutations) such as those associated with cancers, affect their function and how drugs can
      be made to target specific proteins in order to treat disease. Growing a crystal is difficult and unlikely.
      To improve their chances, a crystallographer may set up hundreds of microscopic experiments. In each
      experiment, the protein of interest is mixed with a different ‘cocktail’ of chemical components that has
      been selected from a library of these cocktails. The experiments are then imaged using a robotic system
      and the micrographs either inspected manually or analysed computationally.
      TeXRank is software, developed by, and currently in use at, the Structural Genomics Consortium (SGC)
      at the University of Oxford. It uses texture analysis to score images for the likely presence of crystals and
      then displays these images to the experimenter in rank order. This reduces the number of images that
      have to be viewed before finding a crystal. This project builds upon this work with the aim of providing
      new tools to the experimenter that have the potential to improve their chances of successfully growing or
      identifying a crystal of a given protein.
      In particular, the project includes:
      - methodology to find a set of chemical cocktail conditions that can be used as a tool to improve the
      solubility of sparingly soluble proteins (a limiting factor in obtaining crystals)
      - a ‘virtual’ experiment to evaluate the potential usefulness of the solubility tool
      - adaptation of image processing and machine learning methods to allow TeXRank to use microscope
      images, captured under green light, of experiments containing protein labelled with a fluorescent
      dye
      - an evaluation of the usefulness of the novel combination of texture analysis with fluorescence
      labelling, both in comparison to standard imaging and to studies in the literature.
      The main outcomes of this project were:
      - a set of 48 chemical cocktail conditions, selected through mining the results of image analysis on
      real experimental data and found to be significantly better as solubility tool than a random set of
      conditions (p < 0.05)
      - adaptations to the TeXRank processing pipeline and the training of a new classifier that allows the
      ranking of images from experiments containing fluorescent labelled protein
      - a comparison of ranking performance between pairs of images taken of the same experiments,
      proving that the use of fluorescence in combination with texture analysis is better than texture
      analysis alone
      - the fluorescence classifier created in this project also has superior ranking characteristics (area
      under receiver operating characteristic curve) to the current classifier used by TeXRank
      - comparison to the research literature determined that texton analysis was more accurate at detecting
      fluorescent protein crystals than a recent study that utilised image thresholding followed by edge
      detection
